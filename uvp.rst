System Configuration and Sampling
---------------------------------
The Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP5) HD (High Definition) serial number 201 was programmed, mounted on the rosette, and charged.
This instrument is owned by Emmanuel Boss at University of Maine.
The UVP5 is outfitted with a High Definition 4 Mp camera with an acquisition frequency of up to 20 Hz.
This optical imaging device obtains in situ concentrations and images of marine particles and plankton throughout the water column, capturing objects sized ~100 µm to several cm in diameter.
The camera of the UVP5 HD is different from the previous non-HD version, but the operations are identical for both.
The instrument and data processing are described in [Picheral2010]_.
Depth trigger mode was used throughout the entirety of the cruise, programmed to turn on at 15 m with a maximum depth of 6000 m.
A 20 m soak for one minute was used throughout the cruise.

Problems
-------------------------
See Leg 1 report for details on UVP problems.

No data were downloaded during Leg 2 due to inability to establish communication with the unit.
The intrument was run on all core stations and left off for bio stations.
The instrument will be sent to the manufacturers for maintenance who will open the bulkhead and hopefully download the data from the remaining stations.

Future Data Analysis
--------------------
A combination of machine learning and manual validation will be used to sort images using the Ecotaxa database.
Images will be sorted into various zooplankton taxa and detrital categories.
Zooplankton categories will include crustacea (including copepods and krill), gelatinous (larvacean, jellyfish, salps), and rhizaria.
Examples of these images are shown in Fig. 1.
