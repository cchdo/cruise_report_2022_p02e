Four GO-BGC Argo floats were deployed during the cruise with the float numbers continuing from leg-1 (table below).
All floats were UW-modified Teledyne Webb Apex floats equipped with SBE41-CP CTDs, |O2|, |NO3|, pH, and FLBB bio-optical sensors, and provided by the UW float lab (S. Riser Argo lab).
Before deployment the float sensors were prepared (cleaned) according to the written instructions provided with the floats.
Floats were deployed from the aft deck after the last CTD profile for that station with the ship steaming at 0.5kts.
The floats were lifted over the stern, then carefully lowered into the water with a slip-line strung through the deployment collar of the float.
All of the floats began reporting data immediately and the initial profiles indicate that all sensors were operating well. 

All deployments occurred at stations where bio casts were carried out.
In addition to the standard bio-cast sampling, additional water samples were collected below the mixed layer as well as at, above and below the chlorophyll maximum.
The additional samples were analyzed for FCM, POC and POCN. 

All floats were adopted by different schools as part of the adopt-a-float program (https://www.go-bgc.org/outreach/adopt-a-float).
Names and images provided by the schools were drawn on the floats before deployment.
Each school received details from their deployment via posts on the GO-BGC expeditions webpage, handled by George Matsumoto (MBARI) and Jennifer Magnusson.
