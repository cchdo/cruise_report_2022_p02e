Project Goals
-------------
The goal of this project is to evaluate viral abundances within the cellular fraction (0.22µ Sterivex PC filter) and viral fraction (0.02µ Anotop Filter).

Sampling
--------
Two liters of water were taken from the surface from every other bio-cast, and the last three bio-cast for a total of 14 stations sampled.
Samples were sequentially filtered through a 0.22µ sterivex and 0.02µ anotop filter for 1.5-2.5 hours or when the filter clogged.
Below is a table of stations and amount filtered.
The filters were then frozen at -80ºC and hand carried back to UCSB to organize shipping to University of Exeter for further analysis.
The filters will then be used for DNA extractions at University of Exeter to describe cell associated viruses and free viral particles [Martinez-Hernandez]_.
